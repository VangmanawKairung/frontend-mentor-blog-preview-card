## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (CSS Variables)
- Flexbox
- Absolute positioning and media queries
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Figtree)
- Figma – for design and layout reference

### What I learned

One of my key learnings in this project was working with Figma designs and translating them into a functional web page. This experience helped me practice how to carefully analyze spacing, alignment, colors, and typography in the design, then implement them using semantic HTML and CSS. I also realized how Figma can make the process more efficient, and I gained more confidence in building a responsive layout directly from a design file.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue improving my skills in Figma. Currently, I am only using the basic features, and I believe there are many advanced functions that could help speed up my workflow and make the design-to-code process more efficient. My goal is to explore these tools further and integrate them effectively into my development process.
